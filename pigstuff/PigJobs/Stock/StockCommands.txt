Open the folder
  infochimps_dataset_4778_download_16677 > NYSE 
and locate the two data files that you will be using for this tutorial:
NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv
NYSE_dividends_A.csv


Line 1: define a relation with an input schema named STOCK_A that represents the NYSE stocks that start with the letter “A”
Line 2: use the DESCRIBE command to view the STOCK_A relation
The completed code will look like:
STOCK_A = LOAD 'NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float);
DESCRIBE STOCK_A;



Define the following B relation, which is a collection of 100 entries (arbitrarily selected) from the STOCK_A relation.
	B = LIMIT STOCK_A 100; 
	DUMP B;

Select specific columns from a relation
One of the key uses of Pig is data transformation. You can define a new relation based on the fields of an existing relation using the FOREACH command. 
Define a new relation C, which will contain only the symbol, date and close fields from relation B.
C = FOREACH B GENERATE symbol, date, close;
DUMP C;

Store relationship data into a HDFS File
STORE C INTO 'output/C';


Perform a join on two NYSE data sets: 
the daily prices and the 
dividend prices. 

Dividends prices are shown for the quarter, while stock prices are represented on a daily basis.



STOCK_A = LOAD 'NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); 

DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float); 

C = JOIN STOCK_A BY (symbol, date), DIV_A BY (symbol, date); 

DUMP C;

Notice C contains all the fields of both STOCK_A and DIV_A. 




Use the ORDER BY command to sort a relation by one or more of its fields.

DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float);

B = ORDER DIV_A BY symbol, date asc; 

DUMP B;



Filter and Group the data using “GROUP BY”

The GROUP command allows you to group a relation by one of its fields. 
DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float); 

B = FILTER DIV_A BY symbol=='AZZ'; 
C = GROUP B BY dividend;
DUMP C;
